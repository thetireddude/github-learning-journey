hello

i just learned how to change the default branch name from master to main
I am not sure why it named my main branch master since all git versions after 2.28 should name their default branch main 

i renamed the master branch of my local repo to main

i couldn't see my changes after i pushed for the second time because I now had two branches in my GitHub repo --> master and main
so, i tried to delete master from the remote repo. But, it wouldn't let me because master was still the default branch for my remote GitHub repo 
Therefore, I learned to switch my GitHub default branch 

On second thoughts, I have decided to maintain this repo, as a personal journal of sorts, to keep track of all issues I encountered while learning how to commit and push files from a local repo to my remote repo

I also thought that, now that the instructions are fresh in my head, I should write them down

git init 				--> initializes a new local repo in your current directory
git status 				--> shows all untracked/modified files
git add <filename> / git add . 		--> stages (prepares for a commit) the specific file/ all files 
git commit -m "<message>" 		--> commits the files. the "-m" denotes the message for the commit 
git remote add origin <repo link> 	--> links your local repo to the online GitHub repo on the website
git remote set-url <link> 		--> changes the link of your origin (origin is the name for your remote Github repo)
git push -u origin main 		--> pushes the commit to the main branch of your GitHub repo 

git branch 				--> lists all the branches in your local repo 
git branch -r 				--> lists all branches in your remote repo
git branch -m master main 		--> changes the name of the master branch to main
git switch main 			--> switches to the specified branch, in this case, main 

git push origin --delete master 	--> deletes the master branch in the remote repo
